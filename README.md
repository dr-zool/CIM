# NVIDIA TEACHING KIT FOR CIM
NVIDIA Teaching Kits include access to free online DLI courses and electives. 

DLI training reinforces deep learning and accelerated computing concepts presented in the Teaching Kits and teaches students how to apply those concepts to end-to-end projects. Through built-in assessments, students can earn certifications that prove subject matter competency and can be leveraged for professional career growth. Each course presents a self-paced learning environment with access to a GPU-accelerated workstation in the cloud. All you need is a web browser and Internet connection to get started.

The recommended course (with certification) for students learning through the DLI and Robotics Teaching Kits is Fundamentals of Deep Learning for Computer Vision. The recommended course (with certification) for students learning through the Accelerated Computing Teaching Kit is Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++.

Thanks for requesting free access to DLI online, self-paced courses and electives for you and your students. Your promo code is:

This code is to be used at checkout by individual students when they choose “online” content via https://www.nvidia.com/dli. It is good for 200 uses, and expires roughly one year from now. Feel free to request another code later if needed. I would encourage you to encourage your students to take only the most relevant content to the university course you teach. Even though it asks for credit card info, once the promo code is applied and showing $0 cost, you and your students don’t actually have to enter any credit card info.
